Predicting Customer Happiness from Order Experience

Binary Classification Using Python & Customer Feedback Metrics
ðŸ“¦ Customer Sentiment Analysis Project | 2024

ðŸ§­ Overview

This project estimates customer satisfaction based on a small set of survey-like questions related to the ordering and delivery experience. Using Python, we build a simple binary classification model that predicts whether a customer is happy (1) or unhappy (0).
The goal is to demonstrate how subjective feedback can be transformed into actionable insights using basic machine learning techniques â€” helping companies improve service, pricing, and app usability.

ðŸ§  Problem Statement

Can we predict if a customer is happy based on their experience with delivery, product, price, and usability?

ðŸŽ¯ Target Variable

Y: Binary variable indicating customer sentiment
1 = Happy
0 = Unhappy
