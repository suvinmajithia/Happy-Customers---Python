Using Python, I am estimating if a customer is happy or not based on following questions: 
Y = target attribute (Y) with values indicating 0 (unhappy) and 1 (happy) customers
X1 = my order was delivered on time
X2 = contents of my order was as I expected
X3 = I ordered everything I wanted to order
X4 = I paid a good price for my order
X5 = I am satisfied with my courier
X6 = the app makes ordering easy for me
